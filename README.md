# Accentra - Tenant and Maintenance Management

This is a React Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vite for managing tenants and their maintenance requests.

## Project Overview
The Accentra application aims to provide a centralized system for landlords or property managers to track their tenants and handle various maintenance requests efficiently.

## Core Features (Phase 2)
* **React SPA:** Built as a Single Page Application using React.
* **Components:** Utilizes a modular component structure (e.g., `TenantCard`, `MaintenanceRequestCard`, `AddTenantForm`, `AddMaintenanceForm`, `Header`, `Navigation`).
* **Client-Side Routing:** Implements at least three distinct routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/tenants`, `/maintenance`) using `react-router-dom`.
* **Mock API:** Uses `json-server` to simulate a backend API, providing data persistence for development.
* **HTTP Methods:** Implements GET (fetch data), POST (create new records), and PATCH (update existing records).
* **Controlled Forms:** Features controlled components for data input (e.g., adding new tenants, logging maintenance requests).
* **Basic Styling:** Includes fundamental CSS styling for a clean and functional user interface.
